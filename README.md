# Array of Sunshine

JavaScript array exercises

## Usage

**1. Set up the repo locally**

```
$ git clone https://github.com/psalaets/array-of-sunshine.git
$ cd array-of-sunshine
$ npm install
```

**2. Run the tests**

```
$ npm test
```

**3. Open `your-code.js`**

Make the tests pass. You're done when they're all passing.

It's helpful to look at the test files while you work. They're in `tests/`.

### watch mode

Instead of manually running tests over and over, they run automatically if you
replace the step 2 command with

```
$ npm run watch
```
